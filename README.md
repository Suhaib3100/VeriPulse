# VeriPulse
VeriPulse is a real-time “reality firewall” for video calls that detects deepfake impersonation using physiological liveness signals (rPPG) plus active challenge-response. ​ It protects families, banks, enterprises, and governments from AI vishing/impersonation by warning or blocking high-risk actions when a face/voice is likely synthetic.
